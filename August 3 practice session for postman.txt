 1. Custom Headers Challenge
🧪 Goal:
Send a GET request with the following headers:

Content-Type: application/json

Accept: application/xml

User-Agent: KamalikaBot/1.0

🧠 How:
Create a new GET request:
{{base_url}}/posts
 
Go to Headers tab

Add:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Key: Content-Type       → Value: application/json
Key: Accept             → Value: application/xml
Key: User-Agent         → Value: KamalikaBot/1.0
✅ Expected:
You’ll still get JSON back (JSONPlaceholder doesn't support XML)

But this simulates real API negotiation logic

🔹 2. Dynamic Variables in Pre-request
🧪 Goal:
Add a timestamp to each request as a custom header

💡 Pre-request Script:
js
Copy
Edit
pm.variables.set("current_timestamp", new Date().toISOString());
💡 Headers Tab:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Key: X-Timestamp  
Value: {{current_timestamp}}
This simulates what real APIs log in request metadata (timing, trace ID, etc.)

🔹 3. Chaining Requests
🧪 Goal:
Extract id from POST response and use it in a GET request

POST Request:
POST {{base_url}}/posts

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Auto chain",
  "body": "This post was created just now",
  "userId": 1
}
Tests tab (Post-response):
js
Copy
Edit
let jsonData = pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("new_post_id", jsonData.id);
GET Request:
GET {{base_url}}/posts/{{new_post_id}}

This simulates what you'd do in E2E API tests and automation chains.

🔹 4. Data-Driven Testing (Collection Runner + CSV)
🧪 Goal:
Run the same POST request with 5 different titles

How:
Prepare a CSV:

csv
Copy
Edit
title,body
First Post,Hello 1
Second Post,Hello 2
Third Post,Hello 3
In the POST /posts request body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "{{title}}",
  "body": "{{body}}",
  "userId": 1
}
Run the collection with this CSV in Collection Runner

✅ Simulates real-world bulk API testing!

🔹 5. Mock Server (Optional)
You can also create a mock server in Postman to simulate endpoints before the backend is built.
Let me know if you want to try this — it’s optional, but cool for interviews.

🔹 6. Monitor (Cloud-Based Test Runs)
Set up a Monitor to run your collection every hour/day and send alerts if any test fails.
This is how teams monitor production APIs.

🔹 7. Newman + CI/CD
We already talked about Newman — when you get to real CI/CD, you’ll use:

bash
Copy
Edit
newman run your_collection.json -e your_env.json -r cli,html
Let me know when you're ready to integrate it with Jenkins/GitHub Actions.

🔹 8. Postman Flows (Visual Programming)
A drag-and-drop way to chain APIs (less common in companies, more for demo/mock APIs)
