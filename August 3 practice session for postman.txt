 1. Custom Headers Challenge
ðŸ§ª Goal:
Send a GET request with the following headers:

Content-Type: application/json

Accept: application/xml

User-Agent: KamalikaBot/1.0

ðŸ§  How:
Create a new GET request:
{{base_url}}/posts

Go to Headers tab

Add:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Key: Content-Type       â†’ Value: application/json
Key: Accept             â†’ Value: application/xml
Key: User-Agent         â†’ Value: KamalikaBot/1.0
âœ… Expected:
Youâ€™ll still get JSON back (JSONPlaceholder doesn't support XML)

But this simulates real API negotiation logic

ðŸ”¹ 2. Dynamic Variables in Pre-request
ðŸ§ª Goal:
Add a timestamp to each request as a custom header

ðŸ’¡ Pre-request Script:
js
Copy
Edit
pm.variables.set("current_timestamp", new Date().toISOString());
ðŸ’¡ Headers Tab:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Key: X-Timestamp  
Value: {{current_timestamp}}
This simulates what real APIs log in request metadata (timing, trace ID, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Chaining Requests
ðŸ§ª Goal:
Extract id from POST response and use it in a GET request

POST Request:
POST {{base_url}}/posts

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Auto chain",
  "body": "This post was created just now",
  "userId": 1
}
Tests tab (Post-response):
js
Copy
Edit
let jsonData = pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("new_post_id", jsonData.id);
GET Request:
GET {{base_url}}/posts/{{new_post_id}}

This simulates what you'd do in E2E API tests and automation chains.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Data-Driven Testing (Collection Runner + CSV)
ðŸ§ª Goal:
Run the same POST request with 5 different titles

How:
Prepare a CSV:

csv
Copy
Edit
title,body
First Post,Hello 1
Second Post,Hello 2
Third Post,Hello 3
In the POST /posts request body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "{{title}}",
  "body": "{{body}}",
  "userId": 1
}
Run the collection with this CSV in Collection Runner

âœ… Simulates real-world bulk API testing!

ðŸ”¹ 5. Mock Server (Optional)
You can also create a mock server in Postman to simulate endpoints before the backend is built.
Let me know if you want to try this â€” itâ€™s optional, but cool for interviews.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Monitor (Cloud-Based Test Runs)
Set up a Monitor to run your collection every hour/day and send alerts if any test fails.
This is how teams monitor production APIs.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Newman + CI/CD
We already talked about Newman â€” when you get to real CI/CD, youâ€™ll use:

bash
Copy
Edit
newman run your_collection.json -e your_env.json -r cli,html
Let me know when you're ready to integrate it with Jenkins/GitHub Actions.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Postman Flows (Visual Programming)
A drag-and-drop way to chain APIs (less common in companies, more for demo/mock APIs)
